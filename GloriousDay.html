                <p>I was buried beneath my shame</p>
                <p>Who could carry that kind of weight?</p>
                <p>It was my tomb 'Till I met You</p>
                <p>I was breathing but not alive</p>
                <p>All my failures I tried to hide</p>
                <p>It was my tomb 'Till I met You</p>
                <p>You called my name and</p>
                <p>I ran out of that grave</p>

                <p>Now Your mercy has saved my soul</p>
                <p>Now Your freedom is all that I know</p>
                <p>The old made new, Jesus, when I met You</p>
                <p>You called my name and I ran out of that grave</p>

                <p>I needed rescue, my sin was heavy</p>
                <p>But chains break at the weight of Your glory</p>
                <p>I needed shelter, I was an orphan</p>
                <p>Now You call me a citizen of Heaven</p>
                <p>When I was broken, You were my healing</p>
                <p>Now Your love is the air that I'm breathing</p>
                <p>I have a future, my eyes are open</p>
                <p>'Cause when You called my name</p>
                <p>I ran out of that grave</p>
