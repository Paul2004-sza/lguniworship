                <p>I've tried so hard to see it</p>
                <p>Took me so long to believe it</p>
                <p>That you choose someone like me to carry your victory</p>
                <p>Perfection could never earn it</p>
                <p>You give what we don't deserve it</p>
                <p>And you take the broken things and raise them to glory</p>
