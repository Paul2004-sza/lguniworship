                <p>This is my worship, this is my offering</p>
                <p>In every moment, I withhold nothing</p>
                <p>I'm learning to trust You even when I can't see it</p>
                <p>And even in suffering, I have to believe it</p>

                <p>If You say "release", I'm letting go</p>
                <p>If You're in it with me, I'll begin</p>
                <p>And when You say to jump, I'm diving in</p>

                <p>It felt like a burden, but once I could grasp it</p>
                <p>You took me further, further than I was asking</p>
                <p>And simply to see You, it's worth it all</p>
                <p>My life is an altar, let Your fire fall</p>
